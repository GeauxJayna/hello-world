# hello-world
My first repository
My name is Jayna. I did some programming when I was a kid in the 80s at computer camp and learned HTML in the late 90s/early 2000s, and of course have done some PowerShell for Exchange/SharePoint/AD over the past few years, but I really don't know much about programming. I would like to transition to a possible career in programming at some point in the next few years, because I think it would be a great way to find more job opportunities that are rewarding and allow me to potentially work for some companies/organizations with causes I believe in, as well as challenge me to continue learning new things all the time. I also think it would be a great move to allow me to have more flexibility in my work schedule, which will be more important as my husband gets closer to retirement and I'm still working for a while after that.
